# Checking Out Sales with Power BI: A Simple Dashboard

## What's This All About?
This project is about exploring sales data in a simple and visual way using Power BI. I wanted to understand how sales perform each month, which regions do best, and what kind of products sell the most.

## What I Wanted to Know
- How do sales change month by month?
- Which regions have the most sales?
- What categories of products are doing the best?
- Are there any patterns in sales performance?

## Tools Used
- Power BI for dashboard creation
- A dataset called superstore_sales.csv

## What I Did
1. **Loaded the Data:** I imported the sales data CSV file into Power BI.
2. **Cleaned It Up:** I changed the date format to “Month-Year” for easier analysis.
3. **Created Visuals:**
   - A line chart showing monthly sales trends
   - A bar chart comparing sales by region
   - A donut chart showing sales by product category
4. **Added Filters:** I included a slicer so you can filter results by region.
5. **Used Colors:** I added color highlights to show which regions and categories perform the best.

## Things I Found Out
- The **West region** leads in sales most months.
- **Technology** is the top-performing product category.
- Sales go up a lot in **November and December**, probably due to holiday shopping.
- The **South region** has lower sales compared to others.

## What I Learned
- How to build a clean and easy-to-read dashboard in Power BI
- How visuals help explain data clearly
- How filters and slicers let you explore data from different angles
- How to turn raw sales data into insights

## What's in the Folder?
- `Sample.pbix` – The actual Power BI dashboard
- `superstore_sales.csv` – The raw sales data I used
