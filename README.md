# Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

## About the Project

This is a simple Power BI dashboard project created for a data analyst internship task. The goal was to show how sales perform across different regions, product categories, and months.

## Tools Used

- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel (for data checking)
- Dataset: Superstore Sales (CSV file)

## What I Did

1. Loaded the sales dataset into Power BI.
2. Cleaned the data and changed the order date into "Month-Year" format.
3. Created three visuals:
   - A line chart showing sales over time
   - A bar chart showing sales by region
   - A donut chart showing sales by product category
4. Added a slicer to filter data by region.
5. Used colors to highlight high-performing areas.

## Key Insights

- The West region had the highest sales overall.
- Technology products generated the most profit.
- Sales were the highest in November and December.
- The South region showed the lowest sales numbers.

## Folder Contents

- `Sample.pbix` – The Power BI report file.
- `superstore_sales.csv` – The dataset used.
- `Insights.txt` – A file containing 3–4 key takeaways from the dashboard.

## How to View the Dashboard

You can open the `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
